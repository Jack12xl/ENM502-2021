# LU Decomposition



## Introduction

In this homework we are about to implement the LU decomposition in Matlab. Basically, **lowerâ€“upper** (**LU**) **decomposition** or **factorization** factors a [matrix](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Matrix_(mathematics)) as the product of a lower [triangular matrix](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Triangular_matrix) and an upper triangular matrix. 
$$
A=L U
$$
Looking just like this:
$$
\left[\begin{array}{ccc}
a_{11} & a_{12} & a_{13} \\
a_{21} & a_{22} & a_{23} \\
a_{31} & a_{32} & a_{33}
\end{array}\right]=\left[\begin{array}{ccc}
l_{11} & 0 & 0 \\
l_{21} & l_{22} & 0 \\
l_{31} & l_{32} & l_{33}
\end{array}\right]\left[\begin{array}{ccc}
u_{11} & u_{12} & u_{13} \\
0 & u_{22} & u_{23} \\
0 & 0 & u_{33}
\end{array}\right]
$$
The we will use the implemented **LU decomposition** to solve the boundary value problem(**BVP**) discretized by finite difference method.

The diffusion problem is defined like this:





## Problems 

For the rest of the report, I would briefly answer the question raised in each problem statement.



#### **Problem 1: LU decomposition** and **partial** **pivoting**.

The LU decomposition pipeline follows the pseudocode code. The relevant files are `Pivot.m, Decompose.m, LuDecom.m`.



#### Problem 2: Diffusion problem

The diffusion problem is defined as[xxx]
$$
\nabla^{2} T+\alpha=0 \quad \text { with } \quad T=0 \text{ on all boundaries}
$$
The linear system generating code( produce the `A`and `b`) is `DiffusionBVP.m`.



#### Problem 3: Solve the diffusion BVP, Î± = 2.

##### Notable findings:

[xxx] Currently we haven't found notable findings ðŸ˜“. Noticeably, the pattern showed in the 2D cases are becoming more and more rounded with the increasing of the grid resolution.

#### Problem 4: Against the intrinsic Matlab LU function



##### Compare with Intrinsic method

Here we compare the `Decompose`functino with **Matlab** intrinsic `lu`function by solving `Ax = b`. `A` and `b` are generated by random. The matrix size ranges from `256x256` to `768x768`.

| ------------------------------- | ------------------------- |

Here we compare the whole pipeline(i.e. solving `Ax=b`) performance. We compare the grid resolution from `16x16` to `32x32` (i.e. matrix `A` size from `256x256` to `1024x1024`).

##### How does the performance of your decomposition code compare to the intrinsic MATLAB **LU** routine?

From the Fig:3 and Fig:4, we could see that our method log curve is basically scale with constant 3(means O(n^3) overall complexity), as expected. 

While the intrinsic `lu` scales with constant `2` if we apply linear fit( actually it is not from the Fig:3). Well the official `lu` document states that the complexity is also O(n^3). So there must be some inside "dirty" optimization trick with the `lu`.

#####  Does the timing scale as you expect for **LU** in each case? Why or why not?

From the `Fig:3~6`, the timing basically fit our expectation. However , there is still much `noise`, where makes the line does not fit perfectly on constant `3`.  

From the view of **matrix bandwidth**, we guess the memory fetch(we refer to read) for the matrix `A` would cause a constant amount of time on on whole process. As the `n` (size of `A`) goes up, the whole pipeline is gradually dominated by the **LU decomposition** calculation itself. As we could see in `Fig:4`, after some oscillations one first small `n`, the line's slope gradually becomes around `3`.

Besides this, some other process(like overhead of each operation) would surely add some constant on the whole performance. 

#### Problem 5: Plot the solution error

Here we define the solution error as the **L2-norms** between the fine grid and coarse grid.

[xxx]

We are solving the diffusion problem as defined in **problem 2**.

##### Left we show the error on the grid resolution. The resolution ranges from 4x4 to 16x16; Î± = 2.  Right: error on Î±. Î± ranges from 1:8.
